LSTM Improved Model – California Housing Dataset

This project applies an Improved LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Model to the California Housing dataset for predicting median house values based on various socio-economic and geographical features. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and performance visualization.

📌 Features

Data preprocessing on the California Housing dataset

Sequential modeling with LSTM for regression tasks

Improved model architecture with hyperparameter tuning, dropout, and optimizer selection

Visualization of predictions vs actual values

Performance evaluation using regression metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²)
